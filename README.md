# VintageStoryLauncher

An Advanced, Thematic Launcher for Vintage Story (Beta)

 

 Currently in active Beta. More features and polish are coming soon. Stay tuned for updates...

 

   Working for both Windows 11 & Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+)


 This project is a feature-rich, unofficial game launcher for Vintage Story, built to provide players with powerful tools for managing their game
 experience. Combining a beautifully crafted, thematic user interface with a robust and performant backend, the launcher is the perfect companion
 for both casual players and dedicated modding enthusiasts.


 The frontend is developed using the Godot Engine, allowing for a highly customised and visually unique interface that complements the aesthetic of
 Vintage Story itself. The backend logic is written in Rust, ensuring that core operations like file management, game launching, and data processing
 are fast, safe, and reliable. The two are seamlessly connected via GDExtension.


 Key Features:


  * Multi-Instance Management: Create and manage multiple, completely separate installations of Vintage Story. Perfect for maintaining different
    mod-sets for various servers, testing new mods without affecting your primary save, or keeping survival and creative worlds isolated.

  * Seamless Version Control: Easily download, install, and switch between different game versions on a per-instance basis. The launcher handles the
    fetching and setting up to make it trivial to join a server running an older game version or run older mods.

  * Integrated Mod Manager: A dedicated interface allows you to browse and manage your mods for each instance individually. Enable or disable mods
    With a single click, the launcher handles the file organisation behind the scenes.

  * Integrated News Feed: Stay up-to-date with the latest official game news and development blogs, pulled directly into the launcher's home screen.

  * A Unique, Thematic Interface: The launcher features a handcrafted visual design with custom fonts and graphics, creating an immersive experience
    That feels like a natural extension of the game itself.

 

Install Instructions:

  *  Download the file and extract it

  *  Open a terminal and run the file using ./install.sh (on Linux you may need to grant executable permissions)

  *  Follow the instructions.

  The install script should work for both Windows and Linux.
